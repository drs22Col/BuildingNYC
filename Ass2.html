        <p>Oakwood Beach is home to large scale buy outs (and subsequent demolition) of single family residential homes. Both state and local governments have implemented buy out programs. These programs
          require (continue...) by both state and municipal governments.  </p>

        <p>Here is some background to help inform our framing of the data we discover, as we look to focus in on the experiences of people most affected by Sandy, and what has and should be done. Here is a look at very different NY government programs, from the city and the state, to help those who lost their homes. The philosophies and implementations were very different, with great long-term impact on how these people fared after Sandy.</p>
